# 01. Fizz Buzz

Yes, the quintessential programming challenge; _but with a twist_. 

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Create 5 implemenations of a such a program - that is write 5 discrete functions/programs/classes/etc that successfully fulfil the requirements of Fizz Buzz.

# 02. Refactor

Simple apply some refactoring to the included `api.php` class. 

There's no right or wrong refactoring here, we're looking to see what you _could_ or _would_ improve amount this class. 

### Assumption

The `api.php` class aims the interact with a basic JSON REST API - nothing fancy. The API is secured (as currently implemented) with a bearer token authorization header. 

Furthermore, assume the class is within an autoloaded environment.
